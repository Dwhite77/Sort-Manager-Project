//-------------------------------------------------------------
// known bugs
//-------------------------------------------------------------
//there are issues when creating the first barchart that the names of the columns get all bunched up under the y-axis - fixed
// barchart doesn't resize correctly, especially when binary tree is involved. - fixed
// there are issues with the printed out array when it comes to binary tree, its not printing the sorted array, i know the sorting works due to my testing wil have to look more into this - fixed
// there is a timing issue i think, the times for the standard library sorts shoot way up when they are done at the same time as the other sorts. - more testing needs to be done on this.
