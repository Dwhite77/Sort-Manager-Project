//there are issues when creating the first barchart that the names of the columns get all bunched up under the y axis
// barchart doesn't resize correctly, especially when binary tree is involved.
// there are issues with the printed out array when it comes to binary tree, its not printing the sorted array, i know the sorting works due to my testing wil have to look more into this
